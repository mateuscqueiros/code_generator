## Code Generator
This is a small project to practice the examples on Pragmatic Programmer Chapter 3 - Code Generators.

The objective is to convert an entry file (data.txt) to a language of choice. In the case of this project the output is Typescript.

Pull requests with other language parsers are welcome.

TODO:
- Type detection and conversion (currently only inserting the input type with no conversion to TS)
